# medical-system

Node version: 16.1.0
Angular version: 18.16.0

# require software
you need install for run this project:
NodeJS, Angular, Redis and MongoDB

# server
first: npm install
server folder this application on NodeJs and Express.js worked on the backend
To run on a local environment you must create a .env file and add configuration
for a run, you can use the command: node .

# ui
first: npm install
ui folder this application works in Angular
if on the server you set the 2020 port you shouldn't change the configuration
on local environment run using the command: ng serve -o
I recommend use param -o because with it project auto opens on browser
I know this frontend is not beautiful but for now I haven't good idea how this should looked  :)
